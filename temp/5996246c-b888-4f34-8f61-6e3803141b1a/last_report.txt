After carefully reviewing the vacancy details, the candidate's resume, the first analysis report, and the answers provided during the interview, it is evident that the candidate falls short in meeting the requirements for the Lead Generation Manager / SDR Manager position. 

The candidate's experience as an intern assistant for 6 months with Sales Manager and Lead Generation Manager does not meet the required 2 years of experience in B2B sales or Lead Generation or SDR Manager. While the candidate mentioned attending various online courses and webinars to improve their English skills, there is no mention of experience with negotiation skills, CRM tools like Pipedrive, sales automation tools like Snov.io and Sales Navigator, understanding of enterprise buying processes, managing complex sales processes, understanding of PM processes, or sales experience with tech and engineering companies in the US and European markets.

Although the candidate provided positive answers during the interview regarding negotiation skills, experience with CRM tools, sales automation tools, managing complex sales processes, understanding of PM processes, and sales experience with tech and engineering companies, the lack of evidence in the resume raises concerns about the credibility of these claims.

Overall, based on the analysis of the candidate's resume, interview answers, and the vacancy requirements, I would rate the candidate's suitability for the Lead Generation Manager / SDR Manager position at 30%. The candidate lacks the necessary experience and skills required for the role, and there are significant gaps in meeting the key requirements outlined for the position.
